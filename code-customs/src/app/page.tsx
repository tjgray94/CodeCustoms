              Throughout my IT career so far, I have been working to become a better developer by working on 
              self-projects using different languages and frameworks in hopes of advancing my career. Nothing
              much has happened yet but that will not stop me. I plan to continue learning and writing code
              even when the right opportunity finally comes knocking or until my fingers fall off. Anyways, here's 
              a few of the projects I've worked on so far:
            </Typography>

            <Box mt={3} display="flex" flexDirection="column" alignItems="center" gap={3}>
              <BankAppDemo />
              <GameStoreAppDemo />
              <CurrencyConverterDemo />
            </Box>
          </Paper>
        </Stack>
      </Container>

      <Footer />

      {/* <div className="bg-white text-gray-800 font-sans">
